####Explore Mode
**Challenge #1.1:** Copy our index.html and add your own CSS to make it look like the image above (octocat.png). Your CSS should be in a separate file called styles.css. 

**Goal #1.1:** Add a custom stylesheet to index.html.

**Challenge #1.2:** Make sure your project is safe! Create a git repository containing your project files and upload it to Github. 

####Adventure Mode
**Challenge #2.1:** Let's practice writing some custom HTML as well. Follow the pattern in index.html and add 3 more Octocats to your web page. Use the Octodex at http://octodex.github.com if you need some images, or draw your own and include them in your Github repository! 

####Epic Mode
**Challenge #3.1:** Try making your web page responsive when the browser is resized. Here's a hint: consider what CSS rules you know that determine how many items are displayed inline.
